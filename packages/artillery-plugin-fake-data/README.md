# artillery-plugin-fake-data

## Easy randomised test data leveraging falso

With this plugin, you can add random test data using [falso](https://ngneat.github.io/falso/docs) straight into YAML, giving you a wide range of test data options to choose from. You'll also be able to use the same functions in your `beforeRequest`/`afterResponse` hooks. Check the documentation for more information.
