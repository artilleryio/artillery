# Metric / SLO checks with Artillery

With this plugin Artillery can validate if a metric meets a predefined threshold or condition.

If an `ensure` check fails Artillery will exit with a non-zero exit code. This is useful in CI/CD pipelines for automatic quality checks and as a way to check that SLOs are met.
