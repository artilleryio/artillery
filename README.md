# Use Cases

- Prepare for traffic spikes - run load tests to help prepare your API or service for upcoming peak traffic
- Run load tests to help ensure that SLOs are met under load as code and infrastructure config change
- Run continuous smoke tests to catch issues before they reach production
- Run Artillery in CI/CD to prevent performance regressions
- Profile and debug performance issues such as memory leaks, high tail latency caused by GC pauses or high CPU usage, or misconfigured resource pools
- Scale out and run distributed load tests from your own AWS account

# Features

- **Test ANY stack**:  Load test HTTP, WebSocket, Socket.io, Kinesis, HLS, and more
- **Scenarios**: Support for complex *scenarios* to test multi-step interactions in your API or web app (great for ecommerce, transactional APIs, game servers etc).
- **Load testing & smoke testing**: reuse the same scenario definitions to run performance tests or functional tests on your API or backend.
- **Detailed performance metrics**: get detailed performance metrics (response time, TTFB, transactions per second, concurrency, throughput). Track [**custom metrics**](https://artillery.io/docs/guides/guides/extending.html#Tracking-custom-metrics) with high precision (histograms, counters and rates)
- **Scriptable**: write custom logic in JS, using any of the thousands of useful `npm` modules.
- **Batteries-included**: out-of-the-box integrations with external monitoring systems such as Datadog, InfluxDB, Honeygcomb, and Lightstep, [per-URL metrics](https://artillery.io/docs/guides/plugins/plugin-metrics-by-endpoint.html), file uploads, SSL auth, [fuzz testing](https://artillery.io/docs/guides/plugins/plugin-fuzzer.html), and [more](https://www.artillery.io/integrations)!
- **Extensible**: write custom reporters, custom plugins, and custom engines, or customize VU scenarios and behavior
- **Cloud-native**: built for the cloud from day one - run [distributed load tests](https://artillery.io/pro/) from your own AWS account with ease
- **and more!** HTML reports, nice CLI, parameterization with CSV files, CICD integrations
