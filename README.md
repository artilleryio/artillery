  Artillery is an open-source performance & reliability testing suite for developers & SREs
</h2>

- Emulate user behavior with scenarios - with multiple steps, transactions, request chaining, and more
- Run scenarios as **load tests** or **end-to-end** synthetic tests
- **Cloud-scale** and **cloud-native** - run distributed tests from your own AWS account using AWS Lambda
  - AWS Fargate and Kubernetes support coming next!
- **Full-stack attack** - test at the protocol level (HTTP, WebSocket, Socket.io, and more) or with **real headless browsers**
- And lots more: detailed performance metrics, monitoring/o11y integrations, extension APIs for custom scripting in JavaScript, and plugins
