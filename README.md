# Use Cases

- **Peak traffic testing** - ensure your API, e-commerce backend, IoT service can handle max traffic
- **Pre-launch load testing** - building a new API or service? test it before launch
- **Continuous performance testing** - run load tests in CI/CD to stop performance regressions being shipped to prod
- **Profile & debug performance issues** - run load tests to profile & fix high CPU usage, extensive GC pauses, memory leaks, and misconfigured resource pools
- **Semantic monitoring** - run realistic user scenarios against production APIs continuously and alert on wrong responses or errors

# Features

- **Multiple protocols**:  Load test HTTP, WebSocket, Socket.io, Kinesis, HLS and more.
- **Scenarios**: Support for complex *scenarios* to test multi-step interactions in your API or web app (great for ecommerce, transactional APIs, game servers etc).
- **Load testing & Functional testing**: reuse the same scenario definitions to run performance tests or functional tests on your API or backend.
- **Performance metrics**: get detailed performance metrics (latency, requests per second, concurrency, throughput).
- **Scriptable**: write custom logic in JS, using any of the thousands of useful `npm` modules.
- **Integrations**: `statsd` support out of the box for real-time reporting (integrate with [Datadog](http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/dogstatsd/), [Librato](https://www.librato.com/docs/kb/collect/collection_agents/stastd.html), [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/blog/getting-started-with-sending-statsd-metrics-to-telegraf-influxdb/) etc).
- **Extensible**: write custom reporters, custom plugins, custom protocol engines etc.
- **and more!** HTML reports, nice CLI, parameterization with CSV files.

# Plant Some Trees!

We have planted [over 1,500 new trees](https://ecologi.com/artilleryio) with the help of Artillery community. That's a small forest! We're aiming to grow that to a *large* forest - we're thinking 100,000 trees would be neat.

If you've enjoyed using Artillery and would like to help us out, add your tree to the [Artillery.io forest](https://ecologi.com/artilleryio). 🌲🌳🌴 Feel free to drop us a line to let us know too! 💚
