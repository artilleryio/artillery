# Use Cases

- Prepare for traffic surges - run load tests to help prepare your API or service for upcoming peak traffic
- Run load tests in CI/CD to catch and prevent performance regressions before they cause issues for users
- Profile and debug performance issues such as memory leaks, high tail latency caused by GC pauses or high CPU usage, or misconfigured resource pools
- Run smoke tests continuously against production to catch issues (also known as production scripted testing or synthetic monitoring)
- Designed for modern web APIs, headless CMS and e-commerce systems, IoT backends, real-time services, and microservice architectures
- Test internal microservices and components as well as external endpoints
- Scale out and run your tests from your own AWS account with ease

# Features

- **Test ANY stack**:  Load test HTTP, WebSocket, Socket.io, Kinesis, HLS, and more
- **Scenarios**: Support for complex *scenarios* to test multi-step interactions in your API or web app (great for ecommerce, transactional APIs, game servers etc).
- **Load testing & smoke testing**: reuse the same scenario definitions to run performance tests or functional tests on your API or backend.
- **Detailed performance metrics**: get detailed performance metrics (response time, TTFB, transactions per second, concurrency, throughput). Track [**custom metrics**](https://artillery.io/docs/guides/guides/extending.html#Tracking-custom-metrics) with high precision (histograms, counters and rates)
- **Scriptable**: write custom logic in JS, using any of the thousands of useful `npm` modules.
- **Batteries-included**: out-of-the-box integrations with external monitoring systems (Datadog, InfluxDB, Honeygcomb, Lightstep [and more](https://artillery.io/docs/guides/plugins/plugin-publish-metrics.html)), [per-URL metrics](https://artillery.io/docs/guides/plugins/plugin-metrics-by-endpoint.html), file uploads, SSL auth, [fuzz testing](https://artillery.io/docs/guides/plugins/plugin-fuzzer.html), and more!
- **Extensible**: write custom reporters, custom plugins, and custom engines, or customize VU scenarios and behavior
- **Cloud-native**: built for the cloud from day one - run [distributed load tests](https://artillery.io/pro/) from your own AWS account with ease
- **and more!** HTML reports, nice CLI, parameterization with CSV files, CICD integrations

# Plant Some Trees!

We have planted [over 2400 new trees](https://ecologi.com/artilleryio) with the help of Artillery community. That's a small forest! We're aiming to grow that to a *large* forest - we're thinking 100,000 trees would be neat.

If you've enjoyed using Artillery and would like to help us out, add your tree to the [Artillery.io forest](https://ecologi.com/artilleryio). üå≤üå≥üå¥ Feel free to drop us a line to let us know too! üíö
