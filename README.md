# Quickstart

## Install

**minigun** is available via [npm](http://npmjs.org)

`$ npm install -g minigun`

## Run

`$ minigun quick -d 30 -r 5 http://127.0.0.1:3000/test`

This will run a test for 30 seconds with an average of 5 new requests to
`http://127.0.0.1:3000/test` every second.

## Run with a more complex scenario

`$ minigun run hello.json`

Where `hello.json` is your tests script that contains something like:

```javascript
{
  "config": {
      "target": "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
      "phases": [
        { "duration": 120, "arrivalRate": 10 }
      ],
      "defaults": {
        "headers": {
          "content-type": "application/json",
          "x-my-service-auth": "987401838271002188298567"
        }
      }
  },
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "flow": [
        { "get": {"url": "/test"}},
        { "think": 1 },
        { "post": {"url": "/test", "json": { "name": "hassy" }}}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Create a report

Create a graphical report from the JSON stats produced by `minigun run` with:
`minigun report <minigun_report_xxxxx.json>`

An example: :tophat:

# Use cases

- Benchmark the performance of your API or microservice as you're building it
- Ensure new code does not introduce performance regressions
- Test your code for memory leaks
- Benchmark dependencies (libraries, frameworks, external services) to get a
  feel for their performance characteristics before you integrate
- Run load-tests before you launch to ensure your application can meet
  projected demand

# HTTP Features

## GET/POST/PUT/DELETE

Send a GET request:

```javascript
{"get": {"url": "/test"}}
```

POST some JSON:

```javascript
{"post":
  {
    "url": "/test",
    "json": {"name": "Hassy", "occupation": "software developer"}
  }
}
```

POST arbitrary data:

```javascript
{"post":
  {
    "url": "/test",
    "body": "name=hassy&occuptaion=software%20developer"
  }
}
```

## Set headers

You can set headers like this:

```javascript
{"get":
  {
    "url": "/test",
    "headers": {
      "X-My-Header": "123"
    }
  }
}
```

## Chain HTTP requests

You can parse responses and reuse those values them in subsequent requests.

In the following example, we POST to `/pets` to create a new resource, capture part
of the response (the id of the new resource) and store it in the variable `id`.
We then use that value in the subsequent request to load the resource and to
check to see if the resource we get back looks right.

```javascript
{"post":
  {
    "url": "/pets",
    "json": {"name": "Mali", "species": "dog"},
    "capture": {"json": "$.id", "as": "id"}
  }
},
{"get":
  {
    "url": "/pets/{{ id }}",
    "match": {"json": "$.name", "value": "{{ name }}"}
  }
}
```

By default, every response body is captured in the variable `$`, so the
example above could also be rewritten as:

```javascript
{"post":
  {
    "url": "/pets",
    "json": {"name": "Mali", "species": "dog"}
  }
},
{"get":
  {
    "url": "/pets/{{ $.id }}",
    "match": {"json": "$.name", "value": "{{ name }}"}
  }
}
```

**NOTE**: Only JSON is supported at the moment. Support for XML and arbitrary
regexps is in the works.

## Cookies

Cookies are remembered and re-used by individual virtual users. Custom cookies can be specified with `cookie` attribute in individual requests.

## TLS/SSL

By default, Minigun will reject self-signed certificates. You can disable this
behavior (for testing in a staging environment for example):

1. Pass --k (or --insecure) option to `minigun run` or `minigun quick`
2. By setting the `config.tls` property in your test script like so:

```javascript
{
  "config": {
    "target": "https://myapp.staging:3002",
    "tls": {
      "rejectUnauthorized": false
    }
    // ...
  },
  "scenarios": [
    // ...
  ]
}
```

## WebSocket features

Set the `"engine"` field of a scenario to `"ws"` to enable WS support (the
default engine is `"http"`).

```javascript
{
  "config": {
      "target": "ws://echo.websocket.org",
      "phases": [
        {"duration": 20, "arrivalRate": 10}
      ]
  },
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "engine": "ws",
      "flow": [
        {"send": "hello"},
        {"think": 1},
        {"send": "world"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**NOTE**: Support for matching and reusing responses is under development.

## When NOT to use Minigun

Minigun is **not** a web server benchmarking tool. Its sweet spot is performance
testing of applications and APIs with complex transactional scenarios.

Having said that, Minigun is capable of generating 500+ RPS on modest hardware
(a 512MB Digital Ocean droplet). Still though, if you are after raw RPS to
simply hammer a single URL, you may want to use `ab` instead.

**tldr:**
Benchmarking an Nginx installation? Use `ab`. Testing a Node.js
API, a RoR webapp, or a realtime WebSocket-based app? Use Minigun.

# Design

## Declarative tests

**minigun** test cases are 100% declarative. Your test-case describes _what_
needs to happen, not _how_ it happens.

Benefits of this approach:

- Tests can be 100% reproducible, since there is no custom code.
- Test cases can be auto-generated and analysed by other tools - it's just JSON.
- DSLs can be written for any language. We have a JS DSL on the roadmap, and
  one can be written easily for Ruby, Python, Lua or another language.
- Stronger performance guarantees can be made in absence of custom code.

## Statistically-sound testing

### Modeling user arrivals

**minigun** uses the [Poisson distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process)
by default to model how requests are spread over the duration of the test.

**What does this mean in practice?**

If you specify a duration of 60 seconds, with the arrival rate of 10, it means
*on average* 10 users will arrive every second, with for example 8 arrivals one
second and 11 arrivals the next. The inter-arrival period would also be
slightly different every time, i.e. 5 users arriving within 1 second (1000 ms)
would not be evenly spread out 200ms apart.

This may seem like a subtle difference, but in practice it leads to more robust
tests.
