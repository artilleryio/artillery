<em><strong>Artillery</strong> is a modern, powerful, easy-to-use load-testing toolkit.</em> Artillery has a strong focus on developer happiness &amp; ease of use, and a batteries-included philosophy. Our goal is to help developers build <strong>faster</strong>, more <strong>resilient</strong> and more <strong>scalable</strong> applications.
</p>


# Use Cases

- **Peak traffic testing** - ensure your API, e-commerce backend, IoT service can handle max traffic
- **Pre-launch load testing** - building a new API or service? test it before launch
- **Continuous performance testing** - run load tests in CI/CD to stop performance regressions being shipped to prod
- **Profile & debug performance issues** - run load tests to profile & fix high CPU usage, extensive GC pauses, memory leaks, and misconfigured resource pools
- **Semantic monitoring** - run realistic user scenarios against production APIs continuously and alert on wrong responses or errors

# Features

- **Multiple protocols**:  Load test HTTP, WebSocket, Socket.io, Kinesis, HLS and more.
- **Scenarios**: Support for complex *scenarios* to test multi-step interactions in your API or web app (great for ecommerce, transactional APIs, game servers etc).
- **Load testing & Functional testing**: reuse the same scenario definitions to run performance tests or functional tests on your API or backend.
- **Performance metrics**: get detailed performance metrics (latency, requests per second, concurrency, throughput).
- **Scriptable**: write custom logic in JS, using any of the thousands of useful `npm` modules.
- **Integrations**: `statsd` support out of the box for real-time reporting (integrate with [Datadog](http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/dogstatsd/), [Librato](https://www.librato.com/docs/kb/collect/collection_agents/stastd.html), [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/blog/getting-started-with-sending-statsd-metrics-to-telegraf-influxdb/) etc).
- **Extensible**: write custom reporters, custom plugins, custom protocol engines etc.
- **and more!** HTML reports, nice CLI, parameterization with CSV files.
